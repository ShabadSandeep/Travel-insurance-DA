Gather Data : 
From the Data source , get the data/Download the Data in .csv format.
Go through the Data to get some idea where the Data is missing or where we need to do changes.


Connect with visualization Tool :
Connect the data source to the POWER BI tool / Any other visualization tool by clicking on the IMPORT THE DATA from EXCEL button.

ETL :
Perform ETL ( Extract , Transform and Load) 
Once data is imported to POWER BI then we need to perform ETL which is the 1st step of Data analysis. 

Data Cleaning:
Once ETL is done, then we move to Data cleaning where we clean the data by removing the black spaces or replacing the 0â€™s with desired values or any other transformation we need..
This will be done in the POWER QUERY window.

Data modeling:
We create some data models which makes all the tables interconneted.

Data Processing : 
Once cleaning is done, we move to DATA Processing, where we can create New columns or create some Measures, or any other calculations we need.
Once processing is done, we clink on close and apply in power query window which takes us to the Report view of the POWER BI where we create some visuals and play with Data. 

Create some visuals:
Once ETL, data cleaning, and Data processing is done then our data is ready to get visualized. 
We make visuals in the Report view of the tool. Even we can transform the data while we work with the visuals.
Once we create the visuals with respect to the problem statement, then we are ready to create a Dashboard. 

Visualizing the Data:
*We rearrange the Visuals and charts to look like a dashboard.
We apply some Slicers , which gives us the desired data.
Based on the graphs or charts we prepared, we get some insights / suggestions and recommendations from the data.


Insights: 
1) Dashboard where we have Slices by which we can filter the data by Gender.
2) Here we get the Number of product_names by Destination.
3) Here we get the Claims by Agency and Average commission by Agency
4) Gender vs Distribution channel
5) Net sales by Age group.
6) Map shows the Distribution destinations and Count of claim by Destination
7) Slicer by which we get Distribution country wise data for Net sales and Average commission value.
8) Claims by product name and Top 5 Net sales by Product_name

 and many more.
